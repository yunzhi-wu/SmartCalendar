Open questions:
1. How to get history?
   Get the history from calendar as old as possible.
2. Should the history be saved to somewhere?
   The history should be saved to somewhere once it is fetched from google, since someone can remove events anytime.
   But people can add events also, so need try to fetch event from google calendar for those events added later, and
   merge any new events into "database"
3. What is a good history? Planned and executed.
   A good history is an executed event in calendar. It is an positive event.
4. How to describe a target?
