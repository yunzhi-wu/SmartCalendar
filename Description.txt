This calendar can help plan according to targets and histories.
The targets give the direction, while the histories help makes the plan more practical.
Machine learning will be used:
1. Input: targets and history.
2. Output: practical daily calendar.

Some keywords in description:
"Created by SmartCalendar": this event is created by SmartCalendar, and SmartCalendar can safely edit this event.
"Done", "完成", "85%"，它们表示这个日程是否已经执行，以及执行的时间长短百分比。

Open questions:
1. How to get history?
   Get the history from calendar as old as possible.
2. Should the history be saved to somewhere?
   The history should be saved to somewhere once it is fetched from google, since someone can remove events anytime.
   But people can add events also, so need try to fetch event from google calendar for those events added later, and
   merge any new events into "database"
3. What is a good history? Planned and executed.
   A good history is an executed event in calendar. It is an positive event.
4. How to describe a target?
5. 有些任务天天都有，例如工作日上班。这些东西怎么处理？
   最简单的办法就是把它们以“重复出现”的方式标记在日程上。
   但是，如果某些日子不上班，怎么交互呢？把某一次人工删掉。（以后再优化。）
